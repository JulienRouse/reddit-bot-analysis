Roadmap
======

Here is a little plan of action for the future.

It is subject to change.

DONE
====

- v0.1.0: First commit, basic save and load data, can count words frequency.
- v0.2.0: Wordcloud, added tests, docs for readthedocs.org.


TODO
====

- v0.3.0: Use command line argparse to be flexible when launching the script instead of writing in source.
- v0.4.0: Sentiment analysis.
- v0.5.0: Travis CL ? 

- v1.0.0: All the above and clean up. Separate bot-building, wordcloud, and such.

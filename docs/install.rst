Install
=======

For now, the way to get the project is to clone it.

.. code::
   git clone https://github.com/JulienRouse/reddit-bot-analysis.git
   cd reddit-bot-analysis

Then I suggest using a virtual environment to install the dependencies.
For Python3:

.. code::
   python3 -m venv path/to/the/venv

And then use the requirements.txt given in /docs to get all the needed dependencies:

.. code::
   pip install -r docs/rtfd-requirements.txt
   
TODO clean the rtfd-requirements.txt. There are useless dependency in it.


Run
===

TODO add args to the script

.. code:: 
   python karma_breakdown.py
